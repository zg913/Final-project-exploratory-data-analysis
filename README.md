# Final-project-exploratory-data-analysis
## Introduction: 
This is a library that can be used to process data including data cleaning, summary the descriptive statistics, data visulazation, and build exploratory data model. 
## Data Type: 
Clinical data contained participants' info and measurement data that need to be analyzed. 
## Modules: 
1. Part 1: Data cleaning: identifying and handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and transforming variables as needed. This can help to ensure that the data is ready for analysis and that any potential problems or biases are addressed.
2. Part 2: Descriptive statistics: computing descriptive statistics on the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range. These statistics can help to summarize the main characteristics of the data and provide a baseline for further analysis.
3. Part 3: Data visualization: providing a variety of visualization tools for exploring the data. This might include scatter plots, box plots, histograms, and other types of charts and graphs, which help to identify patterns, outliers, and other features of the data that may not be apparent from summary statistics alone.
4. Part 4: Assumption check: testing linear model assumptions. If the data are qualify to be modeled, then go to part 5, if not, then show the descriptive results. 
5. Part 5: Exploratory modeling: building simple models to explore the relationship between variables in the dataset. For example, a library might provide tools for building a linear regression model to examine the relationship between two continuous variables.
