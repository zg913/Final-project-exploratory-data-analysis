1. Part 1: Data cleaning: An EDA library may also provide tools for cleaning and preprocessing the data, such as identifying and handling missing values, detecting and removing outliers, and transforming variables as needed. This can help to ensure that the data is ready for analysis and that any potential problems or biases are addressed.
2. Part 2: Descriptive statistics: An EDA library should also provide tools for computing descriptive statistics on the data, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and range. These statistics can help to summarize the main characteristics of the data and provide a baseline for further analysis.
3. Part 3: Data visualization: An EDA library should provide a variety of visualization tools for exploring the data. This might include scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heat maps, and other types of charts and graphs. Visualization tools can help to identify patterns, outliers, and other features of the data that may not be apparent from summary statistics alone.
4. Part 4: Exploratory modeling: An EDA library may also provide tools for building simple models to explore the relationship between variables in the dataset. For example, a library might provide tools for building a linear regression model to examine the relationship between two continuous variables.
